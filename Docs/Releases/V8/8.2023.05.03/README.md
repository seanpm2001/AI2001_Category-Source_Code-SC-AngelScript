# Version 8 : Release 2023 May 3rd

## V8.2023.05.03

### About

This was a major update to the template set. The following changes were made:

- [x] `Template-Other` was modernized, making use of file previews within the `/`.github/` and `/OldVersions/` directories.
- - [x] `ROOTFILES.base` was added
- - [x] `AUTHORS.md` `CREDITS.wiki` and `INSTALL.rst` were added
- - [x] `/.gitlab/` was added
- - [x] `gitlab-ci.yml` was added
- - [x] `desktop.ini` was added
- - [x] A YAML Linting workflow was introduced
- [x] 4 new template branches were created, inheriting changes from above, branches of which include:
- - [x] `Template-AI2001`
- - [x] `Template-Candroid`
- - [x] `Template-GDScript-Other`
- - [x] `Template-UkraineHistorySimulator-Other`

Some other changes were made to the main branch, such as:

- [x] File previews within [`/OldVersions/`](/OldVersions/) [`/.github/`](/.github/) and [`/Docs/`](/Docs/) were added
- [x] A predecessors page, which lists all of the predecessors to the V8 template
- [x] 1 pull request was archived, but I didn't go for the last 7, as it felt pointless without gathering commit information
- [x] The docs were updated to include info of this release.
- [x] The `/Branches/` documentation was updated

I wanted to do more today, but I didn't have the time, as I waited a long time before resuming work.

This release wasn't tagged, as I don't feel like tagging releases on this project anymore.
